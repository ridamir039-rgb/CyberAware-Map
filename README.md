🌐 CyberAware – Real-Time Global Cyberattack Visualizer
> A visually immersive web application that maps and educates users about real-world cyberattacks in real time.
📌 Inspiration
Cybercrime is on the rise—ransomware, phishing, and DDoS attacks are disrupting global operations daily. As cybersecurity learners, we wanted to create an application that visualizes how often and where these attacks occur, while educating users on what they are and how to stay protected.
🛠Features
- 🗺️ Interactive Map: Displays 40+ real-world cyberattacks with location markers.
- 💡 Glassmorphic Playcards: Animated,  styled attack details.
- 🎬 Welcome Animation: Elegant loader screen powered by Orbitron font and neon glow.
- 🔍 Prevention Tips: Educates users on how to mitigate each attack type.
🖥️ Technologies Used
| Frontend | APIs & Data | Styling |
| HTML5, JavaScript | Google Maps JavaScript API | Glassmorphism (CSS3), Animations |
| JSON (real-world attack data) | Neon Loader |
| Particle.js | Responsive Design |
