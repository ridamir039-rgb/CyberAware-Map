# 🌐 CyberAware – Real-Time Global Cyberattack Visualizer
> A visually immersive web application that maps and educates users about real-world cyberattacks in real time.

## 📌 Inspiration

Cybercrime is on the rise—ransomware, phishing, and DDoS attacks are disrupting global operations daily. As cybersecurity learners, we wanted to create an application that visualizes **how often** and **where** these attacks occur, while educating users on **what they are** and **how to stay protected**.


## 🛠 Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Displays 40+ real-world cyberattacks with location markers.
- 💡 **Glassmorphic Playcards**: Animated, beautifully styled attack details.
- ⏳ **Auto-Closing Cards**: Enhances UX with timed playcard closing on marker click.
- 🎬 **Welcome Animation**: Elegant loader screen powered by `Orbitron` font and neon glow.
- 🇺🇳 **Country Flags + Attack Icons**: Rich contextual markers for better user understanding.
- 🔍 **Prevention Tips**: Educates users on how to mitigate each attack type.



## 🖥️ Technologies Used

| Frontend | APIs & Data | Styling |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| HTML5, JavaScript | Google Maps JavaScript API | Glassmorphism (CSS3), Animations |
| JSON (real-world attack data) | Neon Loader |
| Particle.js| Responsive Design |


## 📊 Dataset

Our `enhanced_data.json` contains 60+ **researched** cyberattack incidents from around the world, including:

- Ransomware attacks in San Francisco (USA)
